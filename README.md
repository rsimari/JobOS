JobOS

An Operating System written in x86 assembly by John Joyce and Robert Simari

Description:

	Our OS was written from scratch in the 1978 version of 16 bit x86 Intel assembly code. We also used a virtual 1.44 IBM floppy disk to load our bootloader and kernel.  The interface of our OS is a simple repl where a user can type and run simple commands or programs. 

	We tried to emulate what the MIT Hackers' experienced with writing code in assembly. 

To Run Our OS on Ubuntu:

1. sudo apt-get install build-essential qemu nasm
2. sh start.sh
